# PT-Analysis
Methods to analyze particle-tracking experiments performed at the lab02 THz SERS rig, NanoPhotonics Centre, Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge. <br>

Work through the Jupyter notebook 'PT_Analysis_forGithub.ipynb', then 'Figure 4 Picocavities forGithub.ipynb' in the subfolder 'Figure 4'. <br>
.py files contain functions called in Jupyter notebooks.

Directions to download the data to create the figures in the paper "Uncovering low-frequency vibrations in surface-enhanced Raman of organic molecules" can be found with the paper. <br>
If you clone this repository, it's recommended that you store the CSV files in a subfolder called 'CSVs/' within the main folder, the raw h5 and wavenumber csv files in a subfolder called 'raw data', and files '2021-11-02_combined.h5', 'BPT_Gen_Wn.csv', and 'Figure 4 Picocavities.ipynb' in a subfolder called 'Figure 4/'.<br>
e.g. raw data > Molecule 1 (TPT) > TPT.h5 , TPT_Gen_Wn.csv <br>
